# Stratosurfer Tail Design

This repo contains design work for a tail component for my [STRIX Stratosurfer](https://www.readymaderc.com/products/details/strix-stratosurfer-pnp) remote controlled airplane. The model went out of stock back in 2020, and it hasn't been restocked since (likely due to supply chain issues). This aircraft from RMRC is wonderful for beginners to the hobby, so I bought a couple of spare parts including a fuselage and wings. Sadly, the tail is still unavailable. I would like to design a tail section that I can 3-D print, hence the Jupyter notebooks in this repo.

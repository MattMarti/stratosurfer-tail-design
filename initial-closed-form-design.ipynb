    "Here we have the dimensions of the wing, but we don't have information about the lift-slope curve $\\partial C_L / \\partial \\alpha_w$, which we need in order to design the tail. I measured the cross section of the wing by wrapping the wing with paper-mache, letting it dry, and tracing the interior. I used my [airfoil plotter](https://github.com/MattMarti/airfoil-plotter) to plot out the diagram and approximate it with a NACA airfoil. I found that it looked approximately like a **NACA 4410** airfoil. Unfortunately, the [NACA airfoil database](http://airfoiltools.com/search/index?m%5Bgrp%5D=naca4d&m%5Bsort%5D=1&MAirfoilSearchForm%5BtextSearch%5D=5408&MAirfoilSearchForm%5BmaxThickness%5D=&MAirfoilSearchForm%5BminThickness%5D=&MAirfoilSearchForm%5BmaxCamber%5D=&MAirfoilSearchForm%5BminCamber%5D=&MAirfoilSearchForm%5Bgrp%5D=naca4d&MAirfoilSearchForm%5Bsort%5D=1&yt0=Search) doesn't have this airfoil.
